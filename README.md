## Installation
For playing you need to:

1- Download the code from this repository.

2- To play this game, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. If you don't already have it installed, you can download and install it from the official  - Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

3- Run main.py in VCS, Pycharm, etc. or open it in console.

The game automatically saves your progress in a database, you can check your stats at any time.

## Gameplay - Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with two players taking turns marking spaces with either an "X" or an "O". The first player to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game. If all nine spaces are filled without either player getting three in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Modes
There are three difficulty modes to choose from:

- Easy
- Medium
- Hard
- There is also a two-player mode that allows two human players to play against each other.

## Playing Against the Computer
When playing against the computer, the game uses an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to determine the computer's moves. The difficulty level of the AI can be adjusted by selecting a mode before starting the game. 

## Technologies Used
This game was written in Python 3, and makes use of the following modules:

- time: Used for a short pause between moves to make the game feel more natural.
- secrets: Used to generate random AI moves in the easy and medium difficulty modes.
- sqlite3: Used to save scores in a database based on player's name.
